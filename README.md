I'm Clover (or Soda if you like) and I'm sometimes playing PT.


Just a  small note, if I blocked your invites or hid you it's probably because either:

a) you made me uncomfortable

b) or we both had issues

c) I sometimes want to



Pls random people DO NOT INVITE ME TO FRIENDS. I prob won't accept it or drop it later. I'm terrible person to be friends with anyways. Also don't add me if your interaction with me just gonna be basically two convos and you later will forget who am I, or I just kick you out from my friend list.

PS: I can be mean. Depends on my mood.


DNI:

- Homophobes, Racists, Proshippers, Zoophiles etc.;
- DSMP fandom (if you have old skin it's fine, I just don't vibe good with these ppl who I met from this fandom);
- Stoliz shippers (Hellverse in general, but I like fans who cosplay characters, but that's pretty much it, idm tho my close friends);
- People who copying my skins (ask for inspo alright?);
- Ragebaiters (I think this is obvious reason, but I can laugh off some stuff);
- AI "artists"/supporters;
- 16 yo's and lower;
- People who bother me when I'm currently having DNI (I often do that or seperate myself usually, often I put my ponies who have DNI so you will know if something that I have DNI or I just kindly ask you to leave. I'm usually trying to find some seperate place from people tho);
- People who cover me non stop (I first kindly ask if something or just move, but if you keep doing it then yeah 🤷);
  

  (This isn't necessary DNI, but I don't like talking about my past relationships so keep in mind I probably will back away in any type of mentions of relationships, even if they aren't related to me)


  Do NOT ask me about supporter if you're stranger. Which is like 99,9% of people. Thx.


Stuff I'm into so far:

- Smiling Friends
- Madoka Magica
- Ena
- There's also few other stuff I'm into so feel free to ask
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

☆ Pronouns: she/her, but he/him is fine too;

☆ My English isn't good because it's not my first language so please keep that in mind;

☆ Where I sit on PT? Depends, but I'm sitting somewhere on Safe Server #1 high up from spawn or idk somewhere low almost in the end of map. Sometimes near signpost close to Glitch area. Close to spawn sometimes in 18+, sometimes also in Safe Server 2 I'm sitting close to spawn, under spawn on bench or somewhere under trees near paths idek;
 
☆ I like playing Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Uma Musume (sometimes) and Madoka Magica Exedra (I play few other games, but my laptop is a little laggy, currently collecting for gaming pc);

☆ So far I'm not into any serious RP, I can play a little, but if anyone would ask I'm not comfy to do it for now;
 
☆ I like also listening to music, any types really (I hate Disco Polo, but somehow I like few songs from this type lol);

☆ I love drawing sometimes (even if I'm not artist tbh), read books, collecting keychains and LPS, trying also rn do cosplay (but I'm not doing everything from scratch because I'm not that talented sadly ;-;);


I think that's all...I prob add something when I have free time or remember something. Cya
