## Hiya!

I'm Clover (or Soda if you like) and I'm currently playing often right now on PT

Just a  small note, if I blocked your invites or hid you it's probably because either:

a) you made me uncomfortable

b) or we both had issues



Also pls DO NOT INVITE ME TO FRIENDS if you under 18 years old. I might compliment your character you made from Pony Town not knowing your age so it's all good, but I don't wanna have minors in my friend list for obvious reasons.


DNI:

- DSMP fandom (if you have old skin it's fine, I just don't vibe good with these ppl who I met from this fandom);
- Stoliz shippers (Hellverse in general, but I like fans who cosplay characters, but that's pretty much it);
- People who copying my skins (ask for inspo alright?);
- Ragebaiters (I think this is obvious reason, but I can laugh off some stuff);
- AI "artists"/supporters;
- 16 yo's and lower;
- People who bother me when I'm currently having DNI (I often do that, or seperate myself usually, often I put my ponies, who have DNI so you will know if something that I have DNI or I just kindly ask you to leave. I'm usually trying to find some seperate place from people tho);
- People who cover me or bother non stop (I first kindly ask if something or just move, but if you keep doing it then yeah ðŸ¤·;

â˜† Pronouns: she/her, but he/him is fine too
 
â˜† I like playing Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Uma Musume (sometimes) and Madoka Magica Exedra (I play few other games, but my laptop is a little laggy, currently collecting for gaming pc)
 
â˜† I like also listening to music, any types really (I hate Disco Polo, but somehow I like few songs from this type lol)

â˜† I love drawing sometimes (even if I'm not artist tbh), read books, collecting keychains and LPS, trying also rn do cosplay (but I'm not doing everything from scratch because I'm not that talented sadly ;-;)

â˜† I'm not giving my discord to random people, even if I have many profiles linked on my straw


I think that's all...I prob add something when I have free time or remember something. Cya
