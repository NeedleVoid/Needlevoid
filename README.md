I'm Clover (or Soda if you like) and I'm currently playing often right now on PT


Just a  small note, if I blocked your invites or hid you it's probably because either:

a) you made me uncomfortable

b) or we both had issues



Also pls random people DO NOT INVITE ME TO FRIENDS. I prob won't accept it or drop it later. I'm terrible person to be friends with anyways, but ye.


DNI:

- Homophobes, Racists, Proshippers, Zoophiles etc.;
- DSMP fandom (if you have old skin it's fine, I just don't vibe good with these ppl who I met from this fandom);
- Stoliz shippers (Hellverse in general, but I like fans who cosplay characters, but that's pretty much it, idm tho my close friends);
- People who copying my skins (ask for inspo alright?);
- Ragebaiters (I think this is obvious reason, but I can laugh off some stuff);
- AI "artists"/supporters;
- 15 yo's and lower;
- People who bother me when I'm currently having DNI (I often do that or seperate myself usually, often I put my ponies who have DNI so you will know if something that I have DNI or I just kindly ask you to leave. I'm usually trying to find some seperate place from people tho);
- People who cover me non stop (I first kindly ask if something or just move, but if you keep doing it then yeah ðŸ¤·);
  

  (This isn't necessary DNI, but I don't like talking about my past relationships so keep in mind I probably will back away in any type of mentions of relationships, even if they aren't related to me)



Stuff I'm into so far:

- TADC
- Smiling Friends
- Madoka Magica
- Ena
- There's also few other stuff I'm into so feel free to ask

â˜† Pronouns: she/her, but he/him is fine too

â˜† My English isn't good because it's not my first language so please keep that in mind
 
â˜† I like playing Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Uma Musume (sometimes) and Madoka Magica Exedra (I play few other games, but my laptop is a little laggy, currently collecting for gaming pc)
 
â˜† I like also listening to music, any types really (I hate Disco Polo, but somehow I like few songs from this type lol)

â˜† I love drawing sometimes (even if I'm not artist tbh), read books, collecting keychains and LPS, trying also rn do cosplay (but I'm not doing everything from scratch because I'm not that talented sadly ;-;)


I think that's all...I prob add something when I have free time or remember something. Cya
