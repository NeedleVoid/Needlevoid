## Hiya!

I'm Clover (or Soda if you like) and I'm currently playing often right now on PT

Just a  small note, if I blocked your invites or hid you it's probably because either:

a) you made me uncomfortable

b) or we both had issues



Also pls DO NOT INVITE ME TO FRIENDS if you under 18 years old. I might compliment your character you made from Pony Town not knowing your age so it's all good, but I don't wanna have minors in my friend list for obvious reasons.





☆ Pronouns: she/her, but he/him is fine too
 
☆ I like playing Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Uma Musume (sometimes) and Madoka Magica Exedra (I play few other games, but my laptop is a little laggy, currently collecting for gaming pc)
 
☆ I like also listening to music, any types really (I hate Disco Polo, but somehow I like few songs from this type lol)

☆ I love drawing sometimes (even if I'm not artist tbh), read books, collecting keychains and LPS, trying also rn do cosplay (but I'm not doing everything from scratch because I'm not that talented sadly ;-;)


I think that's all...I prob add something when I have free time or remember something. Cya
